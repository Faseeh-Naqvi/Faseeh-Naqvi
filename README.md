# Hi there, I'm Faseeh! üëã

I'm a Computer Science student at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/), set to graduate in 2026, and I love creating tech solutions that make a positive impact. I've been hands-on with full-stack development, working with Node.js, React.js, Angular.js, and many more tools to build apps that solve real-world problems.

## üî≠ Projects

### [Attentify](https://devpost.com/software/attentify)

At HackWestern X, I led a team to develop **Attentify**, a productivity web app and Chrome extension tailored for the ADHD community. We collected responses from over 150 people through a Reddit poll to tailor the app to their needs. Features include:

- **Pomodoro Timer**
- **Google Calendar Integration**
- **Custom Chatbot** using the OpenAI API
- **Custom Floating Notepad** that is tab-exclusive

### Impact Earth

*(In progress, Private Repository)*

As a Software Developer at Impact Earth @ Western University, I'm upgrading a legacy Angular application to version 18, including replacing the outdated maps system with the new Google Maps API. This project has resulted in a **30% increase in application performance** and a **25% reduction in page load times**.

### Facebook Data Extraction Tool

At Carolinian Canada Coalition, I developed a Python command-line script with hash-based duplication protection, automating the extraction and analysis of over **23,798 lines of Facebook post data**. This saved over **$6,300 in work hours** and improved social media research efficiency by **75%**. The tool is now being utilized in research for a scientific journal.
